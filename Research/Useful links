I liked the robot at one minute in. very similar to what we may be doing.

Plane paths

Will the laser intersect the flight path of a plane? 
how would we know? 
is there a failsafe that can be installed?
For this we may need the celestial coordinates to draw a line from the device to the star and ask if that line intersects the flight path of a plane? It would be more than that it would be the path that the laser draws between those points. This is open to debate and speculation. but is a start for a conversation on how to address the issue.

Do you need a better bluetooth module? Or is wifi the way to go?

Here are a few sites that may help with the future of the project. 

We have an observatory and they may be able to advise on how to find the stars more precisely. https://grandmesaobservatory.com/who-we-are
Reaching out to them may be beneficial.
