# StarGuide
This project consists of a few different parts

The device and the related arduino/ESP8266 c++ code:

The device consists of 3D printed parts and is controlled by stepper motors
To edit the code for this piece download arduino IDE and the related c++ files (This can be found in the more code section)
The ESP code and code for the device require some dependencies make sure to download them all for the code to work.

The App connects to the device and is the hub for StarGuide

To get the app running, have either android studio or vscode installed and running on your device.
You will also need to download flutter and have a smartphone emulator.

[flutter install link]:https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Once you have those things clone this github into there and you can run the app from the main.dart file.

Project Contributions


Zack: I communicated with the client, created and managed github repo, created the foundation for the flutter app, helped with development of the flutter app including the control page. I developed the code to connect the app side to the device, using esp8266 and c++ code with the arduino editor. I also helped develop some of the code to control the goto laser and the laser galvos. I helped do research and development of a lot of the different components to the project. This includes laws and ethics, flutter libraries, arduino and esp libraries, and some other related things. Aside from technical contributions I helped schedule meeting times for the group and tried to make sure we were on track.

Axel: Personal Contributions were mostly within the app development. I spent a few weeks learning Flutter and Dart. After becoming an amateur on the software, my focus was centered on developing the app. From the app foundation that Zack developed, I developed the UI for the Home Page, Control Page, Constellation Page, and Settings Page. Helped with the integration of our physical laser into our app. I developed the multilangual feature that our client wanted by storing translations into JSON objects and calling those objects on button presses. Was directly involved in the client meetings and group study sessions.


Ethan: I developed and built both the goto laser, as well as the laser projector. I used tinkercad for the 3d printed parts. I sourced all the electornic componets needed to build the project. Made a comprehnsive build guide and a circuit diagram for the eletronics. I also did a lot of research on the constellations, trying to understand star coordinates, and how to align the device as such. I used arduino to operate the device and using an esp8266 we could then send signals remotely from any phone to the arduino to control the device.
